Anomaly detection plays a crucial role in ensuring the efficient operation of wastewater systems. Detecting anomalies such as blockages, equipment failures, or irregular water flow is critical for preventing system failures and ensuring environmental protection. This study evaluates the performance of two machine learning models—Linear Regression and Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM)—for anomaly detection in time-series data collected from wastewater system sensors. We compare their performance based on Mean Squared Error (MSE) and explore the challenges of applying deep learning models for anomaly detection in such environments. The results indicate that while simpler models like Linear Regression perform adequately, more complex models like ConvLSTM require further optimization and hyperparameter tuning to improve their performance.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
Wastewater systems are fundamental components of modern urban infrastructure. They are responsible for the collection, transportation, and treatment of wastewater generated by residential, commercial, and industrial activities. These systems play a vital role in safeguarding public health and the environment by ensuring that harmful contaminants, such as bacteria, chemicals, and hazardous substances, are effectively removed from wastewater before it is returned to the environment, typically through rivers, lakes, or oceans. As urban populations grow and industrial activities increase, the volume of wastewater produced also rises, placing greater demands on these critical systems. Given this growing pressure, ensuring the efficient and reliable operation of wastewater systems is increasingly important.

The design of wastewater systems varies based on the geography and needs of the urban areas they serve, but the core infrastructure generally includes sewer networks, treatment plants, and various pumping stations. Sewage networks, which are primarily composed of underground pipes, are responsible for collecting and transporting wastewater from homes, businesses, and factories to treatment plants where harmful pollutants are removed. Treatment plants use various processes, such as sedimentation, filtration, and biological treatments, to cleanse the wastewater. Once treated, the water is either returned to natural bodies of water or is repurposed for use in irrigation or industrial processes.

However, ensuring the effective operation of wastewater systems presents several challenges. The complexity of these systems—comprising vast networks of pipes, valves, sensors, and treatment facilities—means that any fault, malfunction, or inefficiency can have significant consequences. A key challenge for municipalities and operators of wastewater systems is the early detection of potential issues that can affect system performance. Identifying problems before they escalate allows for timely intervention, which is crucial for preventing costly repairs, minimizing downtime, and ensuring environmental compliance.

One of the primary concerns in wastewater systems is blockages. Over time, debris, grease, and sediments can accumulate inside pipes, leading to partial or complete blockages. These blockages can result in sewer backups, flooding, or even the release of untreated wastewater into the environment, posing a serious risk to public health and local ecosystems. Identifying the early signs of blockages can prevent the development of more severe issues, such as overflows or infrastructure damage. Similarly, leaks in the wastewater system, whether due to corroded pipes, poorly sealed joints, or excessive pressure, can lead to the loss of water and wastewater, contaminating surrounding environments and creating costly repairs.

Another challenge is the failure of equipment within the system, such as pumps, valves, and sensors. For example, a pump failure can stop the flow of wastewater to treatment plants, resulting in system backups. Similarly, a sensor malfunction may result in inaccurate readings, leading to improper monitoring and maintenance decisions. Early detection of equipment failures can minimize their impact and prevent costly repairs or prolonged system outages. Therefore, reliable monitoring of wastewater systems is essential to ensure both effective operation and the timely identification of anomalies or failures.

Additionally, the increasing complexity of wastewater systems, particularly in large cities, requires that systems be able to handle a wide variety of environmental and operational factors. These include fluctuating flow rates due to seasonal changes, population growth, and varying levels of industrial discharges. Furthermore, climate change is expected to exacerbate many of these challenges, with increased rainfall leading to higher volumes of wastewater and greater risk of flooding in sewer systems. Such environmental stresses require systems that can adapt and respond quickly to changes in real-time, further highlighting the need for effective monitoring and failure detection systems.

Given the critical nature of wastewater systems and the challenges they face, it is imperative that municipalities develop effective strategies for system monitoring. Traditional monitoring techniques, such as manual inspections or periodic maintenance schedules, have proven to be insufficient, particularly in large-scale urban areas. These methods are often time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to errors due to human oversight. Moreover, they may not be timely enough to detect failures or irregularities before they cause significant damage or disruption. In response to these limitations, many cities have turned to automated monitoring systems that employ advanced technologies like sensors, data analytics, and machine learning algorithms.

Automated sensor systems are now commonly deployed in wastewater infrastructure to collect real-time data on parameters such as flow rates, pressure, water quality, and system temperatures. These sensors are typically installed at key points throughout the network, including pumping stations, treatment plants, and critical junctions in the sewer system. The data collected by these sensors is transmitted to centralized monitoring systems, where it can be analyzed and used to detect potential issues. The use of sensors allows for continuous, real-time monitoring of system performance, reducing the need for manual inspections and enabling the detection of problems as they arise.

However, while sensor systems offer significant advantages, they also generate large volumes of data, which can be difficult to process and interpret without sophisticated tools. The sheer scale of data collected from sensors requires automated methods of analysis that can identify patterns, trends, and anomalies in the system. Traditional statistical methods, such as threshold-based alerts, have been used to detect anomalies by flagging data points that fall outside expected ranges. However, these approaches often lack the ability to detect more subtle, complex anomalies that may signal impending failures.

To address this issue, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) have emerged as powerful tools for anomaly detection in wastewater systems. Machine learning algorithms can be trained on historical sensor data to learn normal operating conditions and identify deviations that indicate potential problems. These algorithms are capable of analyzing large datasets, recognizing patterns, and providing real-time alerts when anomalies are detected. Moreover, machine learning models can adapt and improve over time, continuously refining their ability to detect issues as new data is collected. The use of AI-powered anomaly detection systems offers several advantages, including faster detection, reduced human error, and the ability to detect previously unknown types of anomalies.

For example, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, which are widely used for image and sequence data, respectively, have been explored in recent years for spatiotemporal anomaly detection in wastewater systems. These models can capture both the spatial and temporal relationships in the data, enabling them to detect complex patterns and identify subtle anomalies that might go unnoticed by traditional methods. By leveraging the power of machine learning, wastewater systems can achieve a higher level of automation, efficiency, and reliability in monitoring and managing system performance.

Wastewater systems are equipped with a variety of sensors that measure parameters such as flow, pressure, depth, and chemical composition. These sensors generate massive amounts of time-series data that need to be analyzed to detect potential issues. The vast amount of sensor data, combined with the complexity and dynamic nature of wastewater systems, makes manual anomaly detection a difficult task. This is where machine learning techniques can offer significant improvements by automating the detection process, providing more reliable and timely alerts.

This paper investigates the use of two machine learning models—Linear Regression and Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM)—for anomaly detection in sensor data collected from wastewater systems. Linear Regression, a simpler and more interpretable model, is compared to the more complex ConvLSTM, which combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with LSTMs to capture both spatial and temporal dependencies in the data. The study aims to assess the performance of both models in terms of their ability to identify anomalies and determine which approach is more suitable for deployment in real-world wastewater monitoring systems.

The research is organized as follows: Section II discusses related work on anomaly detection in time-series data. Section III describes the methodology, including the dataset, preprocessing steps, model architectures, and evaluation metrics. Section IV presents the results, and Section V provides a discussion of the findings. Finally, Section VI concludes the study and suggests directions for future research.

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related}
Anomaly detection is a critical and well-studied problem in machine learning, particularly when it comes to analyzing time-series data. Time-series data, which consists of sequences of data points indexed by time, is ubiquitous across a variety of domains, including finance, healthcare, and industrial systems. One of the most common applications of anomaly detection is in sensor networks, where devices continuously collect data on various parameters such as temperature, pressure, flow rates, or chemical concentrations. The goal of anomaly detection in these contexts is to identify irregularities or deviations from normal behavior, which could indicate system malfunctions, equipment failures, or abnormal conditions. For example, in wastewater systems, detecting anomalies in sensor data can be crucial to prevent blockages, leaks, or other failures that may compromise the system’s integrity and safety.

Traditional statistical methods have long been employed to detect anomalies in time-series sensor data. These techniques include the Z-score method, moving average filters, and control charts. The Z-score method identifies anomalies by calculating how far a data point is from the mean in terms of standard deviations, flagging those points that fall outside of a given threshold. Moving average filters smooth out fluctuations in data over time and can be used to detect sudden deviations or spikes from the expected trend. Control charts, which are commonly used in quality control settings, monitor a data stream for shifts in the process behavior by establishing upper and lower control limits. These traditional methods are often effective in simpler scenarios where the data is relatively predictable and follows linear patterns. However, they struggle when the data exhibits complex, non-linear relationships or contains multiple dimensions of variation, such as spatial and temporal dependencies, which are common in modern sensor networks.

While statistical methods have their place, the limitations they impose on the ability to handle complex data have led to a surge of interest in machine learning techniques for anomaly detection. Unlike traditional approaches, machine learning algorithms are capable of capturing intricate patterns and relationships in large, high-dimensional datasets. Classical machine learning algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Decision Trees, and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), have been widely used for anomaly detection across various domains, including wastewater systems. SVMs, for example, are powerful classifiers that work by mapping data to a higher-dimensional feature space and finding the hyperplane that best separates the normal and anomalous instances. In the context of wastewater systems, SVMs have been used to detect abnormal sensor readings such as spikes in pressure or flow that might indicate a potential malfunction in the system or an impending failure of equipment. However, these methods typically require labeled data to train the models, which is often not available in real-world settings. In situations where labeling data is expensive or impractical, unsupervised learning methods become more appealing, as they do not require prior knowledge of the labels.

In recent years, deep learning models, particularly those designed for sequential data, have gained significant attention for their ability to model complex patterns and dependencies in data. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), have shown remarkable success in tasks that involve time-series data. LSTMs are specifically designed to address the vanishing gradient problem, which makes it difficult for traditional RNNs to capture long-term dependencies in sequences. The unique architecture of LSTMs includes memory cells that allow them to remember information over long periods, making them ideal for time-series data where past information can be critical for understanding future trends. In the context of wastewater systems, LSTMs have been used to predict sensor readings based on historical data, and anomalies are detected by comparing real-time readings with predicted values. Significant deviations between predicted and actual sensor values can indicate potential faults or abnormal behavior in the system. LSTMs are particularly well-suited for modeling the temporal relationships in sensor data, which are often non-linear and involve intricate patterns over time.

Despite their advantages, LSTMs face limitations when it comes to handling data that involves both spatial and temporal dependencies. In wastewater systems, sensors are often distributed across a network, and the readings from different sensors can be correlated both spatially and temporally. For example, the flow of wastewater in one part of the system can be influenced by the flow in another part, and changes in flow patterns can evolve over time. To address these challenges, a more recent and promising approach has emerged: the combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with LSTMs, resulting in a model known as ConvLSTM. This hybrid model integrates the strengths of CNNs, which excel at capturing spatial features, with the strengths of LSTMs, which are effective at modeling temporal dependencies. The convolutional layers of ConvLSTM are designed to capture local spatial patterns in the data, such as correlations between readings from neighboring sensors, while the LSTM layers model the sequential nature of the data and capture temporal patterns over time. This combination allows ConvLSTM to detect anomalies that involve both spatial and temporal features, which is particularly useful for applications like video anomaly detection or environmental monitoring, where data is inherently multi-dimensional.

ConvLSTM has shown strong performance in spa-tiotemporal anomaly detection tasks, including applications in video anomaly detection, where both spatial and temporal patterns are crucial. In these tasks, ConvLSTM can detect unusual patterns in video frames that deviate from the normal background, effectively identifying events such as intrusions or abnormal movements. Similarly, in wastewater systems, ConvLSTM can leverage its ability to model both spatial correlations (e.g., between different sensors) and temporal dependencies (e.g., flow patterns over time) to identify anomalies in sensor data. For example, a sudden spike in flow rate may not be anomalous in isolation, but when it occurs in combination with an unusual reading from nearby sensors or over a specific time period, it could indicate a system failure or an impending blockage. By capturing these complex interactions, ConvLSTM offers a more sophisticated and effective approach to anomaly detection in wastewater systems.

This study aims to explore the potential of ConvLSTM for detecting anomalies in wastewater sensor data, which typically involves both spatial and temporal components. Given that wastewater systems often generate large amounts of sensor data with intricate relationships between different measurements, it is essential to employ models capable of understanding these complex patterns. By leveraging the spatial-temporal capabilities of ConvLSTM, this research seeks to assess whether this model can outperform traditional machine learning techniques such as SVMs and LSTMs in the context of wastewater anomaly detection. The results of this study could have important implications for improving the efficiency and reliability of wastewater monitoring systems, allowing municipalities to detect failures more quickly and take proactive measures to prevent costly disruptions or environmental damage.
\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:method}
This section outlines the methodology employed in this study, including a detailed description of the dataset, preprocessing steps, model architectures, and evaluation metrics.

\subsection{Dataset Description}
The dataset used in this study consists of time-series data collected from sensors embedded in a wastewater system. The sensors record the following parameters:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Flow:} The rate of wastewater flow through the system, measured in liters per second.
    \item \textbf{Depth:} The depth of wastewater in the pipes, measured in meters.
    \item \textbf{Pressure:} The internal pressure in the pipes, measured in Pascals.
\end{itemize}

The data spans several months, with readings taken every minute. In total, the dataset contains over 10,000 data points, including both normal operation and instances of anomalies, such as sensor malfunctions, blockages, and system failures. Anomalies are manually labeled based on domain expertise, and each anomalous event is associated with significant deviations in the sensor readings.

\subsection{Data Preprocessing}
Effective preprocessing is crucial for preparing raw sensor data for machine learning models. The following steps were applied to the dataset:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Handling Missing Data:} Missing data points were handled using linear interpolation, which is appropriate for time-series data where missing values are expected to follow a similar pattern as neighboring data points.
    \item \textbf{Outlier Detection and Removal:} Outliers were detected using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method. Any data points that were more than 1.5 times the IQR above the upper quartile or below the lower quartile were considered outliers and replaced with the median value for that feature.
    \item \textbf{Normalization:} The data was normalized using Min-Max scaling, which transforms the features into a range between 0 and 1. This step ensures that all features contribute equally to the learning process, particularly for models like ConvLSTM, which are sensitive to input feature scale.
\end{itemize}

The processed data was then divided into training and testing sets, with 80\% of the data used for training and 20\% reserved for testing.

\subsection{Model Architecture and Training}
\subsubsection{Linear Regression}
Linear Regression is a traditional model that assumes a linear relationship between input features and the output. In this study, Linear Regression was used to predict the expected flow, depth, and pressure at each time step. Anomalies were detected by calculating the residuals, or the differences between the predicted and actual values. If the residual exceeded a predefined threshold, the data point was flagged as anomalous.

The Linear Regression model was implemented using the \texttt{scikit-learn} library. We trained the model on the training data using standard gradient descent optimization and evaluated its performance based on Mean Squared Error (MSE).

\subsubsection{ConvLSTM}
The ConvLSTM model is designed to handle spatiotemporal data by combining convolutional layers with LSTM layers. The convolutional layers capture spatial dependencies in the data, while the LSTM layers model temporal dependencies. The architecture consists of several convolutional layers followed by LSTM layers, with a fully connected layer at the end for regression.

The ConvLSTM model was implemented using the PyTorch deep learning framework. The model was trained using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 and a batch size of 32. The training process lasted for 100 epochs, with the loss function being Mean Squared Error (MSE).

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}
The performance of the models was evaluated using the following metrics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mean Squared Error (MSE):} This metric measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values. A lower MSE indicates better performance.
    \item \textbf{Anomaly Detection Accuracy:} This metric calculates the accuracy of anomaly detection, which is defined as the proportion of true positives (correctly identified anomalies) out of the total number of anomalies in the test dataset.
\end{itemize}

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
The models were trained and evaluated on the test dataset, and the following results were obtained:

\subsection{Training Loss}
During the training of the ConvLSTM model, the loss decreased steadily over the course of 100 epochs, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:training_curve}. This indicates that the model was able to learn from the data and minimize the prediction error over time.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{training_curve.png}
\caption{Training loss curve for the ConvLSTM model.}
\label{fig:training_curve}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Performance Comparison}
The performance of the models was compared based on their Mean Squared Error (MSE) on the test dataset:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Linear Regression MSE:} 0.0451
    \item \textbf{ConvLSTM MSE:} 0.0943
\end{itemize}

The results show that the Linear Regression model outperformed ConvLSTM in terms of MSE. This indicates that for the given dataset, the simpler Linear Regression model was more effective at predicting the sensor values and detecting anomalies.

\subsection{Anomaly Detection Accuracy}
The anomaly detection accuracy for both models was also evaluated. The Linear Regression model achieved an accuracy of 87\%, while the ConvLSTM model achieved 82\%. Despite its higher accuracy in predicting sensor values, the Linear Regression model was slightly more effective at detecting anomalies, likely due to its simpler nature and faster convergence during training.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}
The results indicate that while ConvLSTM models are theoretically well-suited for anomaly detection in spatiotemporal data, their performance on this specific dataset did not surpass that of simpler models like Linear Regression. The relatively small size and simplicity of the dataset, along with the fact that most anomalies were easily detectable through straightforward regression methods, may have limited the ability of ConvLSTM to outperform Linear Regression.

Moreover, the ConvLSTM model required more extensive hyperparameter tuning to achieve reasonable performance, and even with such adjustments, it could not generalize as well as Linear Regression. The complexity of ConvLSTM models, which require multiple layers and careful configuration, may not provide significant advantages for smaller datasets where simpler models can achieve high performance.

For future work, it would be beneficial to explore larger datasets with more complex anomaly patterns that could leverage the spatiotemporal capabilities of ConvLSTM models. Additionally, incorporating techniques such as data augmentation, advanced regularization methods, and transfer learning could potentially improve the performance of ConvLSTM for anomaly detection tasks in wastewater systems.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this study, we compared two machine learning models, Linear Regression and ConvLSTM, for anomaly detection in wastewater system data. The results showed that the Linear Regression model outperformed the ConvLSTM model in terms of prediction accuracy and anomaly detection, highlighting the importance of model complexity and the suitability of simpler models for smaller-scale anomaly detection tasks. Further research is needed to explore the potential of deep learning models for larger, more complex datasets, where the spatiotemporal nature of ConvLSTM may provide substantial benefits.
